## Insights & Business Recommendations
1. Women-centric marketing

Since women contribute 64% of sales, targeted campaigns (especially on Amazon & Myntra) could increase conversions.

2. Focus on Maharashtra, Karnataka & UP

These states show the highest revenue and can be further expanded with regional offers.

3. Improve return/cancellation rates

Although the 92% delivery rate is strong, improving packaging & product accuracy can reduce returns.

4. Boost slow months

September–December show declining sales. Festive promotions can revive performance.
